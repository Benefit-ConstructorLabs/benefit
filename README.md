# Benefit
## Enabling the unbanked to take contactless payments in person.
--- 

### The vision
In an increasingly cashless society, those who rely on cash are hardest hit.

As fewer people carry loose change, those who rely on the generosity of strangers - homeless people, buskers etc. - are losing the income stream they rely on.

By enabling these people to receive contactless payments, **BENEFIT** aims to make a big difference with a small change in how we give.
